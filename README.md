# PR_Crime_Data

This repository contains one R script to clean, and make accesible in different formats the criminal data of Puerto Rico from January 2012 to March 2018. 

The data is included in two formats at the moment: `Comma Separated Values` and `Feather`.

The data will be made accesible as well via the `mapPR` package that is currently in development. 

To Do list: 

- Add documentation of the data
- Add documentation of the code
- Add license to the data and code
- Verify which other formats might come as useful for people
- Organize everything final and leave repo.
